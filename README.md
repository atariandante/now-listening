### NOW LISTENING   
Small repo based on [Zyphen's Now Playing](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/zyphens-now-playing-overlay.1026/) to show what you're listening on your stream.

### CAVEATS
You need [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip) in order to make this "now listening" reproductor work.

### SETUP
  - Download the *now-listening* folder
  - Put the *now-listening* folder into the *Snip* folder
  - Execute snip
  - Play some Spotify (or whatever reproductor software Snip supports)
  - Happy stream!
  
### WISH LIST
  [] Calc song duration time to display a line that indicates the song progress.
  [] "No song playing" status reflected in the reproductor UI.
  [] Proper dev enviroment.
  [] Full costumization panel.
    - [] Brand/Solid color background.
    - [] Reproductor shape (border).
    - [] Album.
